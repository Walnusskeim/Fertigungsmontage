This software is a piece of digital art. You may admire it, be inspired by it, or reflect on its structure. But you may not execute, compile, modify, distribute, or incorporate any part of it into your own work.

Permission is hereby not granted, under any circumstances, to use this software for any functional, commercial, educational, or personal purpose.

You may view the source code only for contemplative or aesthetic appreciation. Think of it like a painting in a museum: to be observed, not touched.

If you wish to actually use it, however, you must pay the artist.
The price depends on the complexity of the piece, so contact me first before making an offer.

By accessing this code, you agree to treat it as you would a fragile artwork:
with respect, distance, and zero interaction.
